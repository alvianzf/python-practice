# Python practice problems

This repository is for students that want to learn basic python programming, the commented text is the problem. While the answer of the problem will be on the line after.

Note that this is not mine, I merely tried the problems out and type my own solutions to this repository.

### Requirements
python 3+ (I used version `Python 2.7`)
